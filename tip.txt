def my_abs(x):
    if not isinstance(x, (int, float)):  -- this in in parameter type checking
        raise TypeError('bad operand type')
    if x >= 0:
        return x
    else:
        return -x
"from abstest import my_abs"
    --import function my_abs from file abstest.py

In python, 0.1*0.1= 0.010000000000000002, that's because the float accurate issue. we can round it if accurnt not needed.

slice, eg l[100] have 100 elements,  l[0:3] can take first 3,  l[-1:], is take last to head, 0 and -1,
l[::5] is pick up one each 5 elements
l[:] can duplicate whole list

tuple also can use slice

for (i=0; i<list.length; i++) {
    n = list[i];
}

[x * x for x in range(1, 11)]
[x * x for x in range(1, 11) if x % 2 == 0]

example of generator

>>> L = [x * x for x in range(10)]
>>> L
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
>>> g = (x * x for x in range(10))
>>> g
<generator object <genexpr> at 0x1022ef630>  

import os
dir(os) 
upper two command can show os api supported

>>> f = open('dump.txt', 'wb')
>>> pickle.dump(d, f)
>>> f.close()

>>> f = open('dump.txt', 'rb')
>>> d = pickle.load(f)
>>> f.close()
>>> d
{'age': 20, 'score': 88, 'name': 'Bob'}

upper is save and reload Class Instant on Python

fork, father and child process.   getppid() from child process can get fathrer process id.

from multiprocessing import Process  -- this can create multi process on windows

Queue and Pipes can be used for process communication


threading (1st choice), _thread, are two libs for multi-thread
lock is used for multi-thread sync

python has GIL lock, every 100 code lines run, and free GIL lock. So, thread in one core.
GIL is per Process, so, we can use Process to replace Thread

It looks distrubute mulit machine not difficult in python, since python have many support libs.

re is zheng ze biao dai shi lib in phyton.

python has GUI lib

TK, wxWidgets  Qt, GTK  Tkinter is default, and built-in lib

Socket is TCP/IP lib

Email  smtplib and email libs.  email in charge for write email
smtplib is send

poplib is used for receive

How to differ global variable?
Method 1, define global
[python] view plaincopyprint?
#global.py  
GLOBAL_1 = 1  
GLOBAL_2 = 2  
GLOBAL_3 = 'Hello World'

Method 2, use key words
CONSTANT = 0  
def modifyGlobal():  
    global CONSTANT  
    print(CONSTANT)  
    CONSTANT += 1  
if __name__ == '__main__':  
    modifyGlobal()  
    print(CONSTANT)

So, the main function use global variable,  def function is use local variable, if want to use global, need key words

1. Ok, know how to get the table from html source..  Look the table as key words
<table?<thread><tr><td> will contain the table

html.xpath('//div[@class=\"fn_rp_list\"]/table') --> read all div with class name="fn_rp_list", get belower "table"
the return is element

also learn how the regular expression show up

Check Deposit Rate and US exchange rate relationship.  In theory, should Rate down, exchange up, Rate up, exchange down

Deposite Rate: M

2010.10 2.5%~ 2011.7 3.5%
2011.7 3.5%~2015.8 1.75%

US exchange rate: if we look at from 2010, the theory is right. 

2007 7 2008 6.8  2010 6.6 2012 6.3 2014 6.1 2015 6.2  2016 6.5
